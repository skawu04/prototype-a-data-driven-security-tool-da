Prototype a data-driven security tool dashboard

This project aims to create a dashboard for visualizing and analyzing security-related data.
The dashboard will be built using a Python-based web framework (e.g., Flask or Django)
and will utilize various libraries for data visualization (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly).

The dashboard will provide the following features:

1. Data ingestion: Ability to ingest security-related data from various sources (e.g., logs, APIs)
2. Data visualization: Visualize data using various charts and graphs to identify trends and patterns
3. Alert system: Implement an alert system for detecting anomalies and potential security threats
4. User authentication: Implement user authentication and authorization to ensure secure access

Dependencies:
- Flask (or Django) for building the web application
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data visualization
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- SQLAlchemy (or ORM of choice) for database interactions
- scikit-learn for anomaly detection

Components:

1. app.py: Main application file for building the dashboard
2. models.py: Define data models for storing security-related data
3. views.py: Define views for handling user requests and rendering templates
4. templates: Folder for storing HTML templates for the dashboard
5. static: Folder for storing static assets (e.g., CSS, JS, images)
